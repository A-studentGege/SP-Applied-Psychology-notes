- While a diet rich in processed food seems to show an association with depressive symptoms ( BMJ 2020)
    - whole foods: Fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, grilled chicken, fish and beef, and whole grains, nuts and seeds.
    - processed foods: Breakfast cereals, muffins, white bread, sugary yogurts, low fat potato chips, canned foods, processed meats, fruit juices and diet beverages.

Most types of carbs get broken down into glucose, or blood sugar, which your body either uses for immediate energy or stores as glycogen (the storage of glucose) in your liver and muscles  | Your body needs fat for energy and critical functions, such as hormone production, nutrient absorption and body temperature maintenance. Range from 20-35% of total calories.  | proteins are vital for processes like cell signaling, immune function and the building of tissues, hormones and enzemes.10-35% of your total calories intake.

- **Visceral fat**: fat that surrounds the organs. It is not visible from the outside; associated with numerous diseases

### Active components in functional foods
- Functional foods are ingredients that **offer health benefits that extend beyond their nutritional value.** Oats for instance, contain a type of fiber called beta glucan, which has been shown to reduce inflammation, enhance immune function and improve heart health.
- Major classes
    - Antioxidants and phytochemicals
    - Prebiotics and probiotics
    - Others

## Link between exercise and mental health :running:
Research has shown that exercise is an effective but often underused treatment for mild to moderate depression

1. **Cardiovascular**: Often referred to as aerobic, increase your breathing and heart rates. Endurance exercises improve the health of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system
2. **Strength**: Strength training using weight to improve your muscle strength keeping your muscles strong can help with your balance and prevent falls and fall-related injuries
3. **Flexibility**: Activities that lengthen and stretch muscles can help you prevent injuries, back pain and balance problems. A well-stretched muscle more easily achieves full range of motion.
4. **Balance**: Balance training involves doing exercises that strengthen the muscles that help keep you upright, including your legs and core. These kinds of exercises can improve stability and help prevent falls.

- In the same study, people with insomnia were 20 times more likely to develop panic disorder (a type of anxiety disorder)
