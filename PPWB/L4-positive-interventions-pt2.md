# Lecture 4 Positive Interventions (2)

## Present and Future well being :ok_man:
This lecture will introduce positive interventions more towards planning for future well being.

- `PRESENT`: hedonic/subjective well being
    - Happiness comes when you focus on **pleasure attainment** (positive emotions) and **pain avoidance**
- `FUTURE`: eudaimonic/psychological well being
    - Happiness comes when you focus on **personal growth, mastery, self realisation**

### Finding Meaning and Clocking Achievements
Look at `Maslow's Hierarchy of needs`. Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#).

> According to Maslow's original formulation, there are five sets of basic needs: physiological, safety, love, esteem and self-actualization. These needs are related to each other in a hierarchy of prepotency (or strength) beginning with the physiological needs that are the most prepotent of all. If the physiological needs are fulfilled, a new set of safety needs emerges.

Recall that in topic 1, we don't really know how adaptable we are (set goals, it's okay even if we fail); in topic 2, PERMA having meaning and achievements will add to our well-being.

If we have a structure where we set goals / challenge ourselves, we will be able to
- Increase confidence to take on new challenges
- well being

~ Introduce goal setting
- WOOP: working toward a goal
- GROW: problem solving

## Goal setting :dart:
> "Contemporary researchers emphasize that it is the process of striving after goals - rather than goal attainment per se - that is crucial for happiness and positive affectivity." - David Watson

From neuroscience perspective:
- Gives a boost to our Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) which makes us really act on it
- The medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activation allows us to think about what we need to do right now to achieve our goals, and we set the targets accordingly. (start organising our thoughts, energises us)
- Neurologists working on the science of goal-setting have proved that the brain cannot distinguish between reality and imagined reality. So, when we give ourselves a picture of the goal we want to achieve, the mind starts believing it to be real.

### SMART Method :white_check_mark:
- `S (Specific)`–They target a particular area of functioning and focus on building it.
- `M (Measurable)`-The results can be gauged quantitatively or at least indicated by some qualitative attributes. This helps in monitoring the progress after executing the plans.
- `A (Attainable/Achievable)`–The goals are targeted to suitable people and are individualized. They take into account the fact that no single rule suits all, and are flexible in that regard.
- `R (Realistic)`–They are practical and planned in a way that would be easy to implement in real life. The purpose of a smart goal is not just providing the plan, but also helping the person execute it.
- `T (Time-bound)`–An element of time makes the goal more focused. It also provides a time frame about task achievement.

### Types of goals
1. `The Process Goals`: These are the ones **involving the execution of plans**. For example, going to the gym in the morning or taking the health supplements on time, and repeating the same action every day is a process goal. The focus is to form the habit that will ultimately lead to achievement.

2. `The performance Goals`: These goals help in **tracking progress and give us a reason for continuing the hard work**. For example, studying for no less than 6 hours a day or working out for at least 30 minutes per day can help us in quantifying our efforts and measuring the progress.

3. `Outcome Goals`: Outcome goals are the **successful implementations of process and performance goals**. They keep us in perspective and help to stay focused on the bigger picture. Examples of outcome goals may include winning a sport, losing the desired amount of weight, or scoring a top rank in school.

### WOOP Framework :sun_with_face:
- `Wish`: What goal do you wish to set for yourself? Be specific and quantify your goals.
- `Outcome`: Visualise a positive future
- `Obstacles`: What are the obstacles that you may encounter
- `Plan`: What is your plan when you meet obstacles

![WOOP Framework](l4/woop.png)

### GROW Framework :seedling:
- `Goal` - what is it that you wish for future
- `Reality` - what is the current situation? What barriers currently exist between now and achievement of the goal? What are the internal/external obstacles
- `Options` - explore the options for moving forward. e.g., how would you tackle this if time/money wasn't a factor? What else you can do?
- `Will` - agree specific actions and timeframe. What will you do now? When will you do it? How will you know when you've been successful?

![GROW Framework](l4/grow.png)

### How to operationalise with WOOP & GROW? - `Situation support` :people_holding_hands:

> It's about *"Set up your environment"*

- Fix your bad habits. Remove the things that are tempting you.
- Want to be less bothered by Social Media -Delete it from your phone.
- Trying to work -You can put your phone in your bag.
- Place your gratitude journal on your desk so that when you wake up in the morning it's there.
- Set up reminders on your phone.
Surround yourself with likeminded people -the most powerful environments that we have is the other social agents around us. So fill your lives with people who are trying to do similar things

### Growth Mindset - *set up your mind* :revolving_hearts:
- Introduced by Caroline Dweck
- Students with a growth mindset work and learn more effectively, displaying a desire for challenge and resilience in the face of failure
- Those with a fixed mindset believe that you are either smart or you are not. When they fail or make a mistake, they believe that they are just not smart and give up.

### Brain plasticity :brain:
**Connectivity between neurons can change with experience.** With practice, neural networks grow new connections, strengthen existing ones, and build insulation that speeds transmission of impulses.
- The human brain is composed of approximately 86 billion neurons.
- Past - believed that neurogenesis, or the creation of new neurons, stopped shortly after birth.
- Now - the brain possesses the remarkable capacity to reorganize pathways, create new connections, and, in some cases, even create new neurons—a concept called neuroplasticity, or brain plasticity.

#### Benefits of brain plasticity
allows your brain to adapt and change, which helps to promote:
- The ability to learn new things
- The ability to enhance your existing cognitive capabilities
- Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries
- Strengthening areas if some functions are lost or decline
- Improvements that can promote brain fitness

#### To improve brain plasticity :muscle:
Expose yourself to learning environments that offer opportunities for focused attention, novelty, and challenge have been shown to stimulate positive changes in the brain. Particularly during childhood and adolescence. We can try to:
- Learning a new language
- Learning how to play an instrument
- Traveling and exploring new place
- Creating art and other creative pursuits
- Reading 

> Your brain is not a finite organ, it grows the more you exercise it.

> Dont' be disheartened when you meet "failure", you just haven't succeeded yet.
