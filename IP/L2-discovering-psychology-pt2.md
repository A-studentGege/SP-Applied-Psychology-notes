# Discovering Psychology (pt2)

## The Biopsychosocial (BPS) approach
- Commonly used to explain how **nature & nurture factors** impact both mental and physical health
    - Biological factors: age, gender, genetics
    - Social factor: interpersonal relationships, social support, social economics
    - Emotional factors: mental health, beliefs and expectations
- Explaining feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that cannot be explained with just nature or nurture
- Look at a more holistic approach to explaining behavior
- We are product of not only `biological processes` (e.g., genetics) but also for `psychological` (stress, thoughts and beliefs) and `social processes` (e.g., socioeconomic status, peer influence)
- Overall health and well-being is best understood in terms of a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors
