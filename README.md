## Before getting started
This repo is **a compilation of theories/lectures** of all psych modules I've taken in SP, which essentially gave me a cert in applied psychology. (I graduated in 2025, the content may vary over time) I hope the contents provided here will be helpful for you to take a glimpse of what you'll be learning & serve as a clean reference/summary/notes in case you're lazy to do :)

- Of course, it's also friendly to those who just want to take a look of what psychology is and get to know some foundational theories.

In the sections below I will provide a summary of the module, personal rating in terms of my overall experience, and assignment formats during my time. Do note that IT IS SUBJECTIVE & CONTENT MAY CHANGE!!

And I'm also aware that there's a new psych module  `EP0716 Fundamentals in Peer Support` coming up... Do let me know if it's good/bad if anyone takes it?  

> Please enjoy your time in the sea of psychology. ~

## EP0706 Introduction to Psychology (IP)
**IP provides an overview of the field of psychology (so psych in general).** Sub-fields covered include `cognitive psychology`, `behaviourism`, `developmental psychology`, `social psychology`, and `abnormal psychology`. Different psychology approaches the problem from different perspectives, which you may find interested when considering and explaining people's thoughts and behaviours. By leveraging these theories, you can develop effective treatments or solutions to address the issues emerged.

- **Personal rating: 3/5.** My teammates weren't too good so my group assignment was very stressing (involved intensive research and perspectives forming), and help offered by lecturer was kinda limited too ;-; The theories are very solid and all psych enthusiast should take this mod.
- Assignment formats
    - CA1 In-class debate : Research based on BPS (biopsychosocial) model and develop arguments on the spot, rebut doubts and contrasting views.
    - CA2 Media review : select a movie/podcase/documentary from the links given, conduct review based on a chosen psychological approach. Focus on applying the psych concepts learned.
    - CA3 Literature review and presentation.  

## EP0707 Emotional Intelligence (EI)
EI introduced concepts of EI competencies (including personal and social ones) from Daniel Goleman's *Emotional Intelligence* (a book). You may refer to this link [EI Overview: The Four Domains and Twelve Competencies](https://danielgolemanemotionalintelligence.com/ei-overview-the-four-domains-and-twelve-competencies/) for a quick preview, but EI module structures a bit different with 5 main competences (`self-awareness`, `self-regulation`, `motivation`, `empathy`, `social skills`) and competencies under them, 25 in total.

- **Personal rating: 4/5.** It's relatively a chill module where you just need to put in some time to understand the concepts and do assignments at a stable pace. There are many in-class activities in EI (actually in IP and PP too) overall fun and peaceful.
- Assignment formats
    - CA1 peer teaching: your group will be assigned certain EI competencies, do research and teach your classmates yourself in class.
    - CA2 Digital journal: choose 2 competencies and write journal about how you apply them in real-life. Let your creativity burst!
    - CA3 Social media/physical campaign: as the name suggests, conduct a campaign to promote the competencies to your friends/family/strangers...

## EP0711 Applying Positive Psychology to Personal Well-Being (PPWB/PP)
PPWB is a highly experiential module where you need to try out the techniques (we call them interventions) yourself to better understand and believe that small actions may change your perspective towards the more positive direction. These techniques can be shared with your friends and family to improve mental well-being (eg reduce stress and anxiety) ~~my groupmate said this mod is essentially to positively  gaslight yourself xd~~ Anyways it's a fun and more practical psych module.

- **Personal rating: 4.5/5.** It's really fun to conduct the interventions on myself (and others) and observe their effects. By keeping track of the changes, I felt something different. The core of story is basically to take good care of yourself (physically and mentally) and I felt touched by that ;-; Not 5/5 because it was a bit difficult for pure beginner (me) to conduct statistical analysis correctly, luckily I managed to do it under my lecturer's assistance.
- Assignment formats
    - CA1 Reflection journal: experience 2 interventions and record changes
    - CA2 Individual learning journal: similar to CA1
    - CA3 IRB application, poster creation and presentation: to plan an experiment in a professional manner, do it, record data and analyze, and to present the outcome.
