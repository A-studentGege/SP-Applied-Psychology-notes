## Before getting started
This repo is **a compilation of theories/lectures** of all psych modules I've taken (I graduated in 2025, the content may vary over time) I hope the contents provided here will be helpful for you to take a glimpse of what you'll be learning & serve as a clean reference/summary/notes in case you're lazy to do :)

In the sections below I will provide a summary of the module, personal rating in terms of my overall experience, and assignment formats during my time. Do note that IT MAY CHANGE!!

And I'm also aware that there's a new psych module  `EP0716 Fundamentals in Peer Support`... Do let me know whether it's good/bad if anyone takes it?  

> Please enjoy your time in the sea of psychology. ~

## EP0706 Introduction to Psychology (IP)
**IP provides an overview of the field of psychology (so psych in general).** Sub-fields covered include `cognitive psychology`, `behaviourism`, `developmental psychology`, `social psychology`, and `abnormal psychology`. Different psychology approaches the problem from different perspectives, which you may find interested when considering people's thoughts and behaviours. By leveraging these theories, you can develop effective treatments or solutions to address mental issues.

- **Personal rating: 3/5.** My teammates weren't too good so my group assignment was very stressing (involved intensive research and perspectives forming), and help offered by lecturer was kinda limited too.
- Assignment formats
    - CA1 In-class debate : Research based on BPS (biopsychosocial) model and develop arguments on the spots, rebut doubts and contrasting views.
    - CA2 Media review : select a movie/podcase/documentary from the links given, conduct review based on a chosen psychological approach. Focus on applying the psych concepts learned.
    - CA3 Literature review and presentation.  

## EP0707 Emotional Intelligence (EI)

## EP0711 Applying Positive Psychology to Personal Well-Being (PPWB)
PPWB is a highly experiential module where you need to try out the techniques (we call them interventions) yourself to better understand and believe that small actions may vary your perspective towards the more positive direction. These techniques can be shared with your friends and family to improve mental well-being (eg reduce stress and anxiety) ~~my groupmate said this mod is essentially to positively  gaslight yourself xd~~ Anyways it's a fun and practical psych module.

- Personal rating: 4.5/5. It's really fun to conduct the interventions on myself (and others) and observe their effects. By keeping track of the changes, I see something different. The core of story is basically to take good care of yourself (physically and mentally) and I felt touched by that ;-;
- Assignment formats
    - CA1 Reflection journal: experience 2 interventions and record changes
    - CA2 Individual learning journal: similar to CA1
    - CA3 IRB application, poster creation and presentation: to plan an experiment, do it, record data and analyze, present.
