### Conflict management styles
![5 conflict management styles](L6/conflict-management-styles.png)

- **Avoiding**: This style involves minimizing or ignoring the conflict, potentially by delaying the issue or withdrawing from the situation. It's often used when the issue is trivial, resolving the conflict would cause more harm than good, or when there's a lack of time or resources to address the conflict. 
- **Accommodating**: This style prioritizes the other party's needs over your own, often yielding to their demands. It's useful when maintaining a relationship is more important than your own needs, or when the other party has greater expertise or power. 
- **Compromising**: This style involves finding a middle ground where each party makes concessions to reach a solution. It's often used when time is limited, the issue is not crucial, or when a quick resolution is needed. 
- **Competing**: This style emphasizes achieving your own goals and priorities, even if it means sacrificing the other party's needs. It's used when the outcome is extremely important, when there's a need for quick and decisive action, or when the other party is trying to exploit you. 
- **Collaborating**: This style focuses on working together to find a solution that satisfies everyone's needs and interests. It's most effective when the issue is complex, there's a need for a long-term solution, and the parties are willing to invest time and effort in finding a mutually beneficial outcome.
